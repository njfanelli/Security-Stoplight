# Security-Stoplight
<p>The Security Stoplight was developed to track projects within an organization, it also provides a pathway to communicate those initiatives through visualizations that can be consumed at an Executive Level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple workbook has "3" primary tabs that are visible for use:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Security Stoplight" - This tab provides the visualization that is to be shared with senior leaders, it is broken up into four areas:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Funding Provided - This depicts projects that are in motion and have been funded by the organization.</li>
<li>Funding Likely - This is for projects that are in the pipeline, budgeted, initial planning started and maybe just waiting final approval.</li>
<li>Funding Needed - This is for projects that have not started and may or may not have&nbsp; been budgeted for the fiscal/calendar year.</li>
<li>Funding Completed - This displays a list of all the projects completed.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: This tab has logic built in to auto update itself based on the data entered into the Project List tab so the user will not be required to do much on this tab other than change Name, Logo and Date.</p>
<ol>
<li>"Project List" - This is the critical to the overall tool and drives the data visualizations in the Stoplight tab.&nbsp; This worksheet contains the following attributes to be tracked for any project:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Project Name</li>
<li>Risk Level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)</li>
<li>ROM Estimate (Large, Medium, Small)</li>
<li>Leadership Priority</li>
<li>Status</li>
<li>Estimated Time to Complete (Months)</li>
<li>Planned Go-Live</li>
<li>Days Remaining</li>
<li>Personnel Resources Needed to Complete Project</li>
<li>Budget Needed (Hardware/Software)</li>
<li>Gantt Chart visual of projects (month over month)</li>
<li>Regulatory Drivers</li>
<li>Risk Age</li>
<li>Risk of Not Addressing</li>
<li>Overview on Issue</li>
</ul>
<li>"ROM Defined" - This is a basic template that you may reference to determine the Rough Order of Magnitude (aka ROM).&nbsp; Your welcome to change these values to better meet the needs of your organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several hidden tabs created to drive the automation of updating the Stoplight tab, this&nbsp; approach was taken to avoid adding macros/scripts into the workbook.</p>
